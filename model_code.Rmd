## Upload Data


```{r}
score = read_csv("data/Project_1_data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(wkly_study_hours = 
           case_match(

### Look at Correlation

```{r}

```



## Data Preparation

Create model matrix with one hot-encoding and impute missing values with the column average.

```{r}
dummy_col_names = c(
  "gender_male" 
  #, "gender_female"
  
  # , "ethnic_group_A",
  , "ethnic_group_B", "ethnic_group_C" , "ethnic_group_D" , "ethnic_group_E"
  
  # , "parent_educ_some high school"
  , "parent_educ_high school", "parent_educ_some college"
  , "parent_educ_associate's degree", "parent_educ_bachelor's degree"
  , "parent_educ_master's degree" 
  
  
  # , "lunch_type_standard"
  ,"lunch_type_free/reduced"
  
  # , "test_prep_none"
  , "test_prep_completed"
  
  # ,  "parent_marital_status_married"
  , "parent_marital_status_divorced", "parent_marital_status_single"
  , "parent_marital_status_widowed"
  
  # , "practice_sport_never"
  , "practice_sport_sometimes", "practice_sport_regularly"
  
  # , "is_first_child_no"
  , "is_first_child_yes"
  
  # , "transport_means_school_bus"
  ,  "transport_means_private"
  
  # , "wkly_study_hours_< 5 hours"
  , "wkly_study_hours_> 10 hours", "wkly_study_hours_5-10 hours"
)



score_dummies =
  score %>% 
  select(-math_score, -reading_score, -writing_score) %>% 
  dummy_cols(ignore_na = TRUE) %>% 
  select(all_of(dummy_col_names)) %>% 
  ## fill NA's
  lapply(function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE), 3), x)) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```



```{r}

```

## Data exploration

Create table of descriptive statistics.
```{r}

```



Visualization
```{r}

```


Search for outliers. Outliers are defined as points falling 1.5 * IQR outside Q1 or Q3
```{r}
# look for outliers in 

  # of siblings

  # reading

  # writing

  # math


# these are the only 
```


Search for co-linearity/high correlation in predictors
```{r}
score %>% 
  #select(-math_score, -reading_score, -writing_score) %>% 
  as.matrix(math_score~., data =_) %>% 
  cor()
```

Interesting Models


Model Diagnostics
Consider interactions
Plotting
X-values versus residuals
Check for homoscedasticity
Qq-plot of residuals to check that they are normal
If the residuals are not normal, we will use the Box-Cox transformation to find the best . 
Residuals versus leverage
Detect any points that are exerting lots of leverage. We will remove any points that have ___ too much leverage. 
Adjusted R-Squared
CV
For all automatically selecting models, we will do a 10-fold cross validated MSE test. 
Interesting Models
These models are for the discussion section. Weâ€™ll include discussion of models that we have room for. We will not be rigorously validating these models.
