Looking at the potential predictors, students who studied less than 5 hours had lower averages, but the difference between students who studied between 5-10 hours and students more than 10 is minimal. Students on the free/reduced lunch program had lower scores across tests. Similarly, students whose parents had bachelorâ€™s or graduate degrees generally scored higher than students whose parents had highschool degrees or less. When comparing test scores among sex, males had a slightly higher mean Math score while females scored higher in both Reading and Writing.
